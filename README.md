# Air Quality Prediction and Analysis

## Overview

Air pollution is a significant environmental issue that affects public health and ecosystems worldwide. This project aims to analyze air quality data to predict pollutant levels and gain insights into factors affecting air quality. By leveraging machine learning techniques and environmental data, we seek to develop models that can accurately forecast pollutant levels and provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and environmental agencies.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain air quality data from reliable sources such as government agencies, environmental organizations, or research institutions. The dataset should include measurements of various pollutants and meteorological variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of pollutants and identify trends.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing features to capture temporal patterns and incorporate external data sources to improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Air Quality Prediction**: Choose appropriate machine learning models for predicting pollutant levels based on historical data and meteorological variables. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate their performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of trained models using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared). Select the best-performing model for deployment.

6. **Model Interpretation**: Interpret the trained model to understand the relative importance of different features in predicting pollutant levels. Provide insights for policymakers and environmental agencies to develop effective pollution control measures.

7. **Visualization and Dashboard**: Create visualizations such as time series plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate pollutant levels and correlations with meteorological variables. Develop an interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration of air quality data.

8. **Deployment**: Deploy the chosen model and dashboard into a web-based application or integrate them into existing environmental monitoring systems. Ensure scalability, reliability, and real-time updates for continuous monitoring of air quality.
